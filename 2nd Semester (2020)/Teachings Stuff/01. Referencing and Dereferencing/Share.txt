*" * " and " & " operators*
=========================
- Welcome back to C++ Tutorials, today We're gonna study about the building structure of Pointers in C++
- Before getting into the main concept of "Pointers", let me clarify two most basic operators, for better understanding of Pointers and References in C++
- There are two operators, which are used on Variables, Pointers and Refernces to get what we want from them. You will understand what I wanna say in a moment
- The " & " operator, (or _Ampersand operator_ ) is called the "Reference". It recieves the original variable, and returns its memory address.
- Operators function just as the "Functions" function. Operators take values, and return some value.
- The " * " operator, (or _Asterisk operator_ ) is called the "De-Reference". It functions opposite as the " & " operator. It recieves the Memory Address, and returns the value stored there. Or you can say, It converts the Memory Adress into Original Variable.
- Both of these operator are very very useful in Low-Level Programming, and Optimizing your Code in terms of "Code" and Memory. Just remember their usage and function
- See the Syntax of the above two operators.


*General Syntax*
==============
- The Ampersand Operator ("&")

_&VALUE_

- The Asterisk Operator ("*")
We can only Dereference a Pointer, as normal variables contain only values, not the memory addresses. Only Pointers store memory addresses in them.

_*MEM_ADDRESS_



*Difficulty Level*
================
- Easy

*Language used*
=============
- C++ in C Style

*Recommended IDEs*
================
- Visual Studio (As it has Live-Error Detection system and IntelliSense. It automatically Optimizes the code in terms of everything)
- Dev-C++       (As TDM_GCC-Compiler generates the code as we have written, but its slow in performance and doesn't Optimize the code)
- C4Droid       (for Android users)
