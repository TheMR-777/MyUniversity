*File-Handling (2)*
=================
- Here is other Half of the Previous concept of C++, which we discussed earlier (OF_Stream).
- This concept is also of File_Stream (fstream)
- We're gonna learn today, only about _Input_File_Stream_ (called _"ifstream"_ )
- In today's Program, U'll learn how u can read an external (.txt) file via your C++ Program
- This concept is a little bit related to "cin" (console input) concept we used for taking input via a console window

*How This Works?*
===============
- Just try to understand a brief concept here first.
- 1st, we create an object, from "ifstream" class, provided by "fstream" header file. That object does the rest to read anything from External File (It's an Advantage, only available in C++, not in C).
- 2nd, we list the NAME of the External file to the Object, right after the creation of the Object. These steps are done in one single line.
- 3rd, we can use that OBJECT, just as we use "cin" to INPUT a file. Then we store it in the Memory.
- For this, we create a Variable of DATA_TYPE (in our code) similar to the Data in External File.
- Sometimes. for reading multiple lines from External File, while loop is used, in the combination with "getline()" to Recieve every single line from the External File
- Check the Syntax Below for better Understanding

*General Syntax*
==============
- Creating a Header File 1st
_#include <fstream>_

- Creating an OBJECT to Input File
_ifstream OBJECT_NAME ("EXTERNAL_FILENAME.txt");_

- Reading from OBJECT
_OBJECT_NAME >> YOUR_VARIABLE;_

- (Optional) Closing the File
_OBJECT_NAME.close();_

*Difficulty Level*
================
- Easy 
_If u have a concept of ofstream_

*Language used*
=============
- C++

*Recommended IDEs*
================
- Visual Studio / Visual Studio Code (For Technical Users)
- Dev-C++ (As TDM_GCC-Compiler has best of all Error Detection/Debugging Engine)
- C4Droid (for Android)

*Concepts Used*
=============
- Using ifstream to read a file

*Program*
