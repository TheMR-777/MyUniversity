*Standard Templatized Array*
=========================
- STL Arrays are Just like Vectors, but with Static Size, instead of Dynamic Size
- In C++, STL Arrays are used in-place of Normal Arrays, as it gives more flexibility of dealing Elements
- An STL Array Remembers it Size when passed to a function just like Vector (Unlike the Normal Array)
- General Syntax is also Resembles with the Vectors
- If U have the Concept of VECTORS well, this's not a big deal for U.
- Range-Based Loops are Widely used in case of STL Arrays (Concept is Coming Soon ...)

*General Syntax*
==============
- #include <array>
- array<DATA_TYPE, SIZE> NAME;

*Difficulty Level*
================
- Easy (if u know vectors)

*Language used*
=============
- C++

*Recommended IDEs*
================
- Visual Studio / Visual Studio Code (For Light-Weight Application)
- Dev-C++ (As TDM_GCC-Compiler has best of all Error Detection/Debugging Engine)
- C4Droid (for Android)

*Concepts Used*
=============
- STL Arrays

*Program*
=======
- STL_Array.cpp
