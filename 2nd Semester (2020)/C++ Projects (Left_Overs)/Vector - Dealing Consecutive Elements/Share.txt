*Relative Element Dealer*
=======================
- It's the Relative Elements Dealer of a Vector.
- The Function can be Modified using more cases in switch
- The Purpose of this program is to Introduce a new way of Dealing Vectors, Arrays or STL Arrays
- Special Thanks to a UNIVERSITY_STUDENT who gave the Idea, and Cooperated very much!

*Parameter Guide*
===============
- calc( Element of Vector #1 , Element of Vector #2 , Operation on those Elements )

*Difficulty Level*
================
- Regular (MEDIUM)

*Language used*
=============
- C++

*Recommended IDEs*
================
- Visual Studio / Visual Studio Code (For Light-Weight Application)
- Dev-C++ (As TDM_GCC-Compiler has best of all Error Detection/Debugging Engine)
- C4Droid (for Android)

*Concepts Used*
=============
- Vector (Input & Output)
- Function: Pass by Value
- Passing a 3rd variable to the Function as The Operation
- Using Dynamic Vector as Static Vector
- Graphical Environment in Console (optional)
