*File Handling (1)*
=================
- Today, I'm gonna introduce an all new concept of C++, which is File Handling, called File-Stream (or fstream) in C++
- This concept is a little bit different, but related to _"cout"_ and _"cin"_ concepts
- We'r gonna learn today, only about _Output_File_Stream_ (called _"ofstream"_ )
- In today's Program, U'll learn how u can write an external (.txt) file via your C++ Program
- Or, simply, how can you store your output in an external file, by using _"ofstream"_ class and an Object
- One thing to note : As we know, we use "cout" to display output on Console. Just like this, we use an Object to write output on an external file

*How This Works?*
===============
- Just try to understand a brief concept here first.
- 1st, we create an object, from "ofstream" class provided by "fstream" header file. That object does the rest to write anything in External File (It's an Advantage, only available in C++, not in C).
- 2nd, we assign a NAME to the External file, right after the creation of the Object. Both steps are done in one single line.
- 3rd, we can use that OBJECT, just as we use "cout" to OUTPUT a file
- (Optional), U can CLOSE the file, once it is written. Technically, it's an Optional Step, because the Computer automatically closes the file once it is written. But if u get errors, u can close the file forcefully.
- Check the Syntax Below for better Understanding
- Another Important thing, whenever u run the program again, it'll just replace the text, already present in that file. But there's a technique to overcome it as well.

*General Syntax*
==============
- Creating a Header File 1st
_#include <fstream>_

- Creating an OBJECT for Output File
_ofstream OBJECT_NAME ("EXTERNAL_FILENAME.txt");_

- OR (Optional) Creating an OBJECT for Output File (No Overwriting)
_ofstream OBJECT_NAME ("EXTERNAL_FILENAME.txt" , fstream::app);_

- Writing the OBJECT
_OBJECT << ANY_OUTPUT << endl;_

- (Optional) Closing the File
_OBJECT.close();_

*Difficulty Level*
================
- Intermediate , If u have practices previous concepts
- Very Hard    , If u didn't focus on previous concepts

*Language used*
=============
- C++

*Recommended IDEs*
================
- Visual Studio / Visual Studio Code (For Technical Programmers)
- Dev-C++ (As TDM_GCC-Compiler has best of all Error Detection/Debugging Engine)
- C4Droid (for Android)

*Concepts Used*
=============
- Using File Stream to Update External File
- Using Output Stream to Output the text
- It's better to understand the concepts here again :

*Program*
=======
- 1_Easy.cpp     (Easy Concept here)
- 2_Intermediate (More than BASIC Level)
- 3_Advanced     (Used every possible function for Complete Concept)

*Run this Online*
===============
- It's not necessary, because u will not be able to check the Output file while on ONLINE IDE.
