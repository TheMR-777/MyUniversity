/*

- Description of Variables

1. Variables are declared along with their data types in TypeScript.
   It's optional to list the Data type along with variable, but as
   typescript is statically typed language, variables should have a
   data type. And we should be Type-Specific whil in TypeScript.

2. Check the codes below to understand how variables are Initialized
   and Manipulated in TypeScript
