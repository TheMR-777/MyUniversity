# My University Progress
- Here's all the work I have done since I got admission at my University, and started my Programming journey.
- Never considered about saving the progress at GitHub before :)
- Will be kept updated, while I am graduating.
- Update [23-04-23]: I am successfully graduated :)

## Primary Progress
C++ is the primary interest of mine, and most of my progress is in C++,
But these folders also contains my progress in:
- Flutter (as per my secondary interest)
- C# (ASP.NET with some Razor Pages)
- HTML
- TypeScript
- JavaScript
